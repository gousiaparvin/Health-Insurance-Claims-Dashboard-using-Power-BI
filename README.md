# Health-Insurance-Claims-Dashboard-using-Power-BI
Overview
This project visualizes the financial performance of insurance claims processed in January and February for an insurance company. 
The goal is to provide leadership with quick insights into claims data, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Dataset Information
The dataset consists of 1,000 individual claims, each described by 40 attributes across four categories:

Insured Person: Information related to the policyholder.
Policy Information: Details about the insurance policy.
Incident Description: Information about the incident leading to the claim.
Vehicle Characteristics: Details about the vehicle involved in the claim.
The key variable of interest is fraud_reported, which is marked as 1 if the claim is fraudulent, and 0 otherwise.

Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to visualize various factors affecting claims, such as:
The number of claims processed and the total amount approved across various states.
The count and types of incidents.
The impact of gender, vehicle age, and time on claim patterns and fraud detection.

Tools & Skills
Power BI: Used for creating interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics.
Python: Employed for data wrangling and preprocessing to ensure clean data.
Data Analytics: Focused on uncovering trends in claim amounts, incident types, fraud detection, and demographic impacts.

Key Insights
71.44% of claims were vehicle-related, indicating a high frequency of auto-related incidents.
Fraud was most frequently reported by individuals aged 30 to 50, and females reported fraud more often than males.
Illinois had the highest total approved claims, with over $3 million approved in just two months.

Visualizations
The dashboards created using Power BI include:

A Donut Chart showing the breakdown of claim types (vehicle, injury, property).
A Bar Chart displaying the total amount approved by state.
Visuals representing fraud by age and gender, along with incident counts by collision type.

Conclusion
The project delivers a comprehensive overview of the claims data, 
helping leadership quickly grasp the financial and operational impact of claims across different regions and demographics. 
The fraud detection insights enable better fraud prevention measures, reducing the risk to the company.
